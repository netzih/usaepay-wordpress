 * The marker ({orderid, sent_at, amount, exclude}) is written by the caller's
 * store BEFORE the request goes out and stays there until the answer was
 * conclusive and, for an approval, until the caller has recorded it. A later
 * call with the same store finds the marker, looks the orderid up (bounded by
 * when it was sent, so a miss is conclusive) and returns the earlier
 * transaction instead of sending a second one. When USAePay cannot say,
 * nothing is sent.
 *
 * Reading the marker, writing it and sending the request happen under a lock
 * on the orderid (Lock, whose INSERT is the test), so two requests made at the
 * same moment cannot both pass the read; the second one is told to wait. The
 * marker write is read back before anything is sent: a store that did not
 * keep it would leave the request unguarded.
